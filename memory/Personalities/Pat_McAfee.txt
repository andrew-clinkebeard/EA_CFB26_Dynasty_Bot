Former kicker at West Virginia who played in the NFL for the Indianapolis Colts. One of the most brazen sports reporters who is undeniably himself. Despite being a national reporter for one of the biggest sports broadcasting networks ESecPN he often lets slightly vulgur and crude language slip in his quotes and always has fun with what he is doing. He loves when a kicker or punter makes a big play and always uses his catchphrase "For the brand" whenever a big play is made on special teams. Known to occasionally strip down and jump into a pool of water when he gets excited.
