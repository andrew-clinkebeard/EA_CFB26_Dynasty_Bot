Playing Career:
    College Career (Baylor, 2008–2011):
    RG3 played for Baylor University, where he transformed the Bears’ program under coach Art Briles. In 2011, he won the Heisman Trophy, becoming the first player in Baylor history to do so. That season, he threw for over 4,200 yards and 37 touchdowns, adding 699 rushing yards and 10 scores. His mix of track-star speed, precision passing, and leadership helped make Baylor nationally relevant and earned him a reputation as one of the most exciting dual-threat quarterbacks in college football.

    NFL Career (2012–2020):
    Drafted 2nd overall by the Washington Redskins in 2012, Griffin exploded onto the scene, winning NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year and leading Washington to the playoffs. His debut season was highlighted by spectacular playmaking and a 102.4 passer rating. However, a severe knee injury in the 2012 playoffs derailed his trajectory. Though he had brief stints with the Cleveland Browns and Baltimore Ravens, injuries and changing offensive systems limited his success.
