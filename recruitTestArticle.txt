 Austin’s John Trout: Track Speed, Big Arm — and Baylor’s Next Dual-Threat Catalyst?

Background and high school performance
If you cover Texas high school quarterbacks long enough, you learn to stop being surprised by what comes out of Austin. Still, John Trout forces a double take. The 6'2", 184-pound quarterback has piloted one of the city’s perennial contenders, elevating an offense that blends tempo, RPOs, and vertical shots into one of the state’s most efficient units.

As a junior, Trout threw for 3,142 yards and 33 touchdowns against 7 interceptions, completing 66.8% of his passes. He added 742 rushing yards and 9 scores on the ground. The analytics back up the eye test: his estimated EPA per dropback ranked in the top decile of Texas 6A starters, and he posted a +4.1% completion percentage over expected. On throws of 20-plus yards, Trout completed 47.9% with a 10–2 TD-INT ratio, and his pressure-to-sack rate stayed a tidy 12.6% thanks to plus pocket feel and legitimate pull-away speed. Coaches in the district clocked him at a laser 4.58 in the 40 and 21.1 mph 
on GPS during a scramble drill this spring.

“I take a lot of pride in being a point guard who can push the ball,” Trout said. “We play fast, and I’m comfortable making the right read, but also taking the deep shot when it’s there. If they spin the safeties, I’ll make them pay. If they drop, I’ll take the free yards with my legs.”

Strengths and playing style
Trout’s tape is built on two premium traits: speed and throw power.

- Speed: He’s more than a chain-mover. Trout can erase pursuit angles once he hits the second level. His scramble rate hovered around 8%, but those were drive-flippers — 27 of his scrambles went for first downs. On designed QB runs (zone read and GT counter), he averaged 7.1 yards per carry. He’s patient pressing the mesh, then sudden through the B-gap.

- Throw power: The ball jumps off his hand. Trout consistently drives field-side comebacks from the opposite hash and layers seams between split safeties. At summer camp, he registered a mid-50s velocity reading and replicated it on the move, indicating real off-platform juice. You see it on boundary 
hole shots and that firm, chest-high RPO glance.

- Processing and rhythm: His high school offense gave him full-field reads in two-minute, and he handled it. Average time to throw sat at 2.67 seconds, but when the call sheet demanded rhythm, he triggered under 2.5 seconds and showed anticipatory windows on digs and glance routes. He’s comfortable changing arm slots and plays on time more than most dual-threats.

Areas to develop: He’ll need to add 10–15 pounds of functional mass for the Big 12 grind and tighten lower-half mechanics when resetting late in the down; occasional heel-clicks cause balls to sail on intermediate outs. Middle-of-field anticipation versus bracket looks is the next chess move.

Why he’s a fit for Baylor
Scheme fit is clean. Baylor wants to live in a tempo spread with wide splits, stress you with RPOs on early downs, then throw vertical seams off play-action. They’ve increasingly leaned into moving the launch point and using the quarterback as a run threat to balance the box count. Trout checks all three.

- Vertical stressor: His arm stretches the field horizontally and vertically, forcing safeties to honor the go/post wheel menu Baylor favors. Hash-to-sideline throws become routine, which widens the alley for Baylor’s wide-zone and counter schemes.

- RPO acumen: Trout posted a 58% success rate on tagged RPOs; he’s comfortable reading apex defenders and replacing vacated windows with no wasted motion. Baylor’s glance/choice package should translate day one.

- QB run element: His speed punishes even fits. Baylor can build QB counter bash, speed option, and naked keepers to leverage Trout’s acceleration, creating plus-one numbers without sacrificing tempo.

“We see a true dual-threat who doesn’t have to be run-first to be dangerous,” a Baylor offensive assistant told me. “The GPS speed is real, the ball gets on people fast, and he processes. We can keep our full RPO and vertical menu with him — and add back more designed QB run without tipping anything. 
That’s rare.”

Trout echoed the synergy. “Baylor’s pace and the way they let the quarterback control protections and RPO tags really stood out,” he said. “They’re telling me I can be myself — push it downfield, use my legs when it’s smart, and play fast. That’s how I grew up playing.”

Notable achievements and comparisons
- District Offensive Player of the Year; led his team to a 12–2 mark and a 6A regional final.
- Elite regional camp finalist with top-five velocity and shuttle times.
- Two-sport background: spring track contributor who split time on the 4x200 relay, supporting the verified top-end speed.

The film comp that makes sense: think a leaner Max Duggan with a little more arm, or Malik Cunningham’s acceleration paired with Will Howard’s willingness to drive intermediate windows. He’s not the finished product those college vets became, but the stylistic echoes are there — tough, explosive on the move, and unafraid to attack the deep third.

What coaches love is how the traits show up in winning moments. Trout posted a 59% success rate in the fourth quarter and improved to 51% completion on 20-plus yard throws when trailing by one score — indicators of poise and decision-making under stress.

“I’ve been working on the small stuff — base, eyes, protections,” Trout said. “Speed and arm are gifts, but I want to be the guy who gets us into the right play and finishes drives. That’s what wins in November.”

The bottom line
In an era where the Big 12 is defined by spacing, tempo, and multiplicity, John Trout brings a scarce blend: legitimate track speed that tilts the numbers game, and a live arm that punishes single coverage. Baylor has made him a priority because he answers the modern test — can your quarterback be your best conflict creator? For Trout, the answer is yes, and the data backs it up. If the frame fills out and the middle-of-field anticipation continues 
to grow, he projects as a multi-year starter with all-conference upside in Waco
